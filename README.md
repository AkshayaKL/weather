 -The basic features of the webpage are:  
     -When you aren't sure about a specific region but want to get an overall Idea,you can use the drop down list  
     -Clicking on the set button after clicking on the desired option gives the weather details with the graph  
     -The graph shows the temperature variation over 10 days  
     -Other than that,typing in the location itself in the provided input box[with autofill]will do the same  
     -Also dragging and placing the marker anywhere on the map,gives the weather details  
     -The background changes according to the peratining weather conditions
